# ✅ Stripe Setup Complete!

Your Stripe test keys have been configured successfully!

## 🔑 Configured Keys

- **Publishable Key**: `pk_test_51SkSEvGKPkzXCzxq...` ✅
- **Secret Key**: `sk_test_51SkSEvGKPkzXCzxq...` ✅ (stored in `server/.env`)

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

1. **`.env`** (root directory) - Frontend configuration
   - `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Added
   - `REACT_APP_PAYMENT_API_URL` - Added

2. **`server/.env`** - Backend configuration
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Added
   - `PORT=3001` - Added
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Added

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
npm install express stripe cors dotenv
```

### 2. Start the Backend Payment API Server

Open a **new terminal window** and run:

```bash
npm run payment-api
```

You should see:
```
✅ Stripe Payment API server running on port 3001
📝 Make sure STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is set in .env
🔗 API endpoint: http://localhost:3001/api/payments
```

**Keep this terminal running** - the backend server needs to stay active.

### 3. Start the Frontend

In your **main terminal**, restart the frontend:

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Test the Payment Flow

1. Log in to your app
2. Accept a proposal
3. When the payment modal opens, you should see **Stripe Elements** (not "Mock Payment Mode")
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/25`)
6. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
7. Complete the payment

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend dependencies installed (`npm install express stripe cors dotenv`)
- [ ] Backend server running (`npm run payment-api`)
- [ ] Frontend restarted (`npm start`)
- [ ] Payment modal shows Stripe Elements (not mock mode)
- [ ] Test payment successful

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Stripe not initialized" in console

- Make sure `.env` file has `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Restart frontend after updating `.env`

### "Failed to create payment intent"

- Make sure backend server is running (`npm run payment-api`)
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Verify `server/.env` has `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

### Payment modal shows "Mock Payment Mode"

- Check `.env` has correct `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Restart frontend completely (stop and start again)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Stripe integration is now fully configured and ready to process test payments!

For production, you'll need to:
1. Get production keys from Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `.env` files with production keys
3. Deploy backend API to a hosting service
4. Update `REACT_APP_PAYMENT_API_URL` to production URL
