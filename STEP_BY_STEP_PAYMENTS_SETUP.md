# 📋 Step-by-Step: Create Payments Table in Supabase

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST run the SQL in Supabase!

The SQL file I created (`CREATE_PAYMENTS_TABLE.sql`) needs to be **executed in Supabase's SQL Editor**. Just having the file isn't enough!

## 🔍 Alternative: Quick Verification

After running the SQL, you can verify by running this in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'payments';
```

If you see `payments` in the results, the table exists!
